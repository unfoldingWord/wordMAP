that time there were still\nmany people groups\nin Canaan left them there\nYahweh\nto test\nthe Israelite people\nbecause many of the Israelites\nnot\nhad fought\nin any of\nthe previous wars\nin Canaan\nSo Yahweh did this\nhow to wage\nthe new generation of\nIsraelites\nto teach\nwar\nand their five\nleaders\nThe Philistines\nthe people living in the area near\nthe descendants of Canaan\nthe city of Sidon\nand the Hivites\nwho were living\nin the mountains of\nLebanon\nbetween Mount\nBaal\nHermon\nand\nLebo\nHamath the pass of Hamath\nYahweh left these people groups there\nto test\nthe Israelites\nto see\nif they would obey\ncommands\nhis\nwhich\nhe had told\nthem\nto give\nMoses\nThe Israelites\nlived\namong the people groups of\nthe Canaanites\nthe Hittites\nthe Amorites\nthe Perizites\nthe Hivites\nand the Jebusites\nBut the Israelites took\nthe daughters of those people\nto be their\nown wives\nand\ntheir own daughters\ngave\nto those men to marry them\nAnd they worshiped\nthe gods of those people\ndid\nThe Israelites\nthings that were very evil\nsaid\nYahweh\nThey forgot about\nYahweh\ntheir God\nand they started to worship\nthe idols that represented the god Baal\nand\nthe goddess Asherah\nTherefore was very angry\nYahweh\nwith Israel\nhe handed them over\nthat they might live under the power of\nKing Cushan\nRishathaim\nwho was king of\nAram\nNaharaim in Mesopotamia\nserved\nThe people of Israel\nCushan\nRishathaim\nfor eight\nyears\nBut when pleaded to help\nthey them\nto\nYahweh\nbrought\nhe\na leader to rescue\nthem\nHe was

of\nCushan\nRishathaim\nand Othniel defeated\nthem\nAfter that there was peace\nin the land\nfor forty\nyears\nuntil died\nOthniel\nAfter that again\nthe Israelites\ndid\nthings that had forbidden them to do\nYahweh\nmade much stronger\nYahweh\nthe army of King Eglon\nwho ruled\nthe land of Moab\nso that he could defeat\nthe Israelites\nthings that were very evil\nEglon persuaded to join\ntheir armies with his army\nthe leaders of\nthe Ammonites\nand the Amalekites\nto attack\nIsrael\nThey captured\nJericho which was called The City of Palm Trees\nThen ruled\nthe Israelites\nEglon\nKing\nfor eighteen\nyears\nBut then again pleaded to help them\nthe Israelites\nto\nYahweh\nSo brought\nhe\nto rescue them\nanother leader\nHe was Ehud\nson of\nGera\nfrom the descendants of Benjamin\na man\nleft handed\nsent to give\nThe Israelites\nhim\nthe money he required every year so he would not attack them\nto Eglon him\nKing\nhad with him\nEhud\na short sword\ndouble edged\none half meter\nin length\nHe hid by strapping\nit the sword\nunder\nhis clothes\nto\nthigh\nhis right\nHe gave\nthe money\nto Eglon\nKing\nwho was\na man\nfat\nvery\nThen Ehud started to go back home\nwith the men\nwho had carried\nthe money\nhe told the other men to go on but he himself turned around and went back to the king of Moab\nWhen they arrived at\nthe stone quarries\nnear Gilgal\nWhen he arrived at the palace he said to the king\na message\nsecret\nI have\nfor you\nYour majesty\nSo the king told\nto be quiet\nand he sent them out\nof the room\nall\nservants\nhis\nEhud\ncame\nclose to him\nThen as Eglon\nwas sitting\nin the upstairs room\nof his summer palace\nalone\nand said\na message\nfrom God\nI have\nfor you\nJust then the king got up\nfrom\nhis chair\nAs the king got up reached\nEhud\nwith\nhand\nhis left\nand pulled\nthe dagger\nfrom\nthigh\nhis right\nand plunged it\ninto the king s belly\nHe thrust it in went into the king s belly\nso far that\nthe handle\nHe left it there\nthe king s fat\nburied in\nwith the handle\nnot\nEhud did pull\nthe dagger\nout\nand he went out\nfrom the room\nThen left the room went out\nEhud He\nto the porch\nHe shut\nthe doors\nto the room\nand locked them\nAfter he\nhad gone\nKing Eglon s servants\ncame back\nbut they saw that\nthe doors of\nthe room\nwere locked\nThey said\nmust\nbe defecating\nThe king\nin the inner room\nSo they waited\nafter a while\nthey were worried\nbut when\nnot\nthe king did open\nthe doors of\nthe room\nThey got\na key\nand unlocked the doors\nAnd they saw that\ntheir king\nwas lying\non the floor\ndead\nEhud\nescaped\nMeanwhile\nHe\npassed by\nthe stone quarries\nand arrived at\nSeirah in the hill country where the descendants of Ephraim lived\nThere\nhe blew to tell everyone that the people should join him to fight the people of Moab\na trumpet\nSo went went down toward the Jordan River\nwith him\nthe Israelites They\nfrom\nthe hills\nwith Ehud\nleading them\nHe said\nto the men\nSo follow\nme\nis going to allow us to defeat\nYahweh\nyour enemies\nthe people of Moab\nSo they down to the river\nfollowed him\nand they stationed some of their men\nat the place where people can walk\nacross the river\nto escape\nin order that they could kill\nany people from Moab\nwho tried to cross the river\nthe Israelites killed\nfrom Moab\nAt time\nthat\nabout ten\nthousand\npeople\nThey were all\nstrong\nand\nmen\ncapable\nbut not\nescaped\none of them\nconquered\nthe people of Moab\nday\nOn that\nthe Israelites\nThen there was peace in\ntheir land\neighty\nfor years\nAfter Ehud died\nbecame their leader\nShamgar\nIn one battle he killed\nPhilistines\nsix\nhundred\nwith an goad\nox\nrescued from the Philistines\nHe\nthe Israelites\nagain\nthe Israelites\nstarted doing\nthings evil\nsaid were very\nYahweh\nAfter Ehud\ndied\nSo allowed to conquer the Israelites\nhe\nthe army\nof Jabin\none of the kings\nin the region of Canaan\nwho\nruled\nin the city of Hazor\nThe commander of\nhis army\nwas Sisera\nwho\nlived\nin Harosheth\nwhere many of those who were not Israelites lived\nThen pleaded to help them\nthey\nto\nYahweh\nnine\nhundred\nchariots\nmade out of iron\nSisera s army had\nhe\noppressed\nthe Israelites\ncruelly\ntwenty\nFor years\nNow Deborah\na woman who proclaimed the word of Yahweh\nwho was the wife of\nLappidoth\nwas a leading judge\nin Israel\nat time\nthat\nShe\nwould sit\nunder\nher palm tree they called it the palm of\nDeborah\nat a place between\nRamah\nand\nBethel\nin the hill country where\nthe descendants of Ephraim lived\nand would come\nto her\npeople\nand ask her to settle their legal disputes She would determine what was right and fair\nOne day she sent\nand called him to come to her\nfor Barak\nson of\nAbinoam\nHe was from Kedesh in\nthe area where the descendants of Naphtali lived\nShe said\nto him\nThis is what is commanding you to do\nYahweh\nthe God worship\nwe\nand gather all your men together\nat Mount\nTabor\nTake\nwith you\nten\nthousand\nmen\nsome from Naphtali\nand some from Zebulun\nYahweh will make me able to persuade to come\nto\nthe river\nKishon a few miles away\nSisera\nthe commander of\ns army\nKing Jabin\nwith\nhis chariots\nand\nhis army\nI will enable your men to defeat them there\nreplied\nBarak\nonly if\nyou go\nwith me\nI will go\nIf\nnot\nyou will go\nwith me\nnot\nI will go\nShe replied\nIndeed\nI will go\nwith you\nBut because that is what you have decided to do\nand the result will be that\nno one will honor you\nfor doing that\nto defeat\na woman\nwill enable\nYahweh\nSisera\nSo\nDeborah\nwent\nwith\nBarak\nto Kedesh\nThere summoned\nhe\nmen from Zebulun\nand\nNaphtali\nthere\nand then they went together\nTen\nthousand\nmen\ncame to him to Mount Tabor\nwith\nDeborah\nAt that time Heber with his wife Jael Heber\nthe Kenite\nhad moved away from\nthe Kenites\nwas a descendant of\nHobab\nfather in law\nMoses\nand set up\nhis tent\nnear\nthe big oak tree\nnear\nKedesh\nSomeone told\nSisera\nthat\nhad gone up\nBarak with an army\nson of\nAbinoam\non Mount\nTabor\ngathered\nSisera\nwith their nine\nhundred\nchariots\nhis troops\nand they marched from Harosheth\nwhere the non Israelites lived\nto\nthe river\nKishon\nThen said\nDeborah\nto\nBarak\nGet going\nThis is\nthe day\nthat\nwill enable your army\nYahweh\nthe army of Sisera\nto defeat\nYahweh\nis going\nahead of you\nSo as they descended\nBarak\nfrom Mount\nTabor\nhis men\nled\nAs they advanced caused to have great difficulty maneuvering around\nYahweh\nSisera\nand\nall\nhis chariots\nand\nhis army\nSo jumped down\nSisera\nfrom\nhis chariot\nand ran away\nBut Barak and his men\npursued\nthe other chariots\nand\nthe enemy soldiers\nas far as\nHarosheth\nwhere the non Israelites lived\nThey killed\nall of the men\nin s army\nSisera\nNot\nsurvived\none man\nBut Sisera\nran\nto\ns tent\nJael\nher husband\nHe did that because\nwas a good friend of\nSisera s master Jabin\nof the city of Hazor\nHeber\nwent out\nJael\nto greet\nSisera\nShe said\nto him\nSir\ncome into my tent\nnot\nDo be afraid\nSo he went and lay down\ninto the tent\nand she covered him\nwith a blanket\nHe said\nto her\ngive me\ncan you\nsome\nwater\nI am thirsty\nSo she opened\na leather container of\nmilk\nand gave him a drink\nThen she covered him with a blanket again\nHe said\nto her\nStand\nin the entrance of\nthe

Sinai\nwhen you appeared there because\nyou are Yahweh\nthe God of\nIsrael\nWhen was our leader\nShamgar\nand in the days of\nJael\nwe were afraid to walk on\nthe main roads\ninstead\ncaravans of travelers\nwalked on\nwinding less traveled roads to avoid being molested\nPeople left their small villages and moved into the walled cities\nuntil\nI became their leader\nDeborah\nI became like\na mother\nto the Israelite people\nWhen the Israelite people abandoned Yahweh and chose\ngods\nnew\nenemies attacked\nthe gates of the cities\nthe shields\nand then they took away\nand spears\nfrom forty\nthousand\nIsraelite soldiers\nI am thankful for\nthe leaders and soldiers\nwho volunteered to fight\nI praise you for them\nYahweh\nYou wealthy people who ride\non donkeys\nsitting\non\nnice padded saddles\nand you people who just walk\non\nthe road\nthink about all this\nListen to the voices of the singers\nwho gather at\nthe places where the animals drink water\nThey tell about\nhow acted righteously\nYahweh\nwhen he enabled the Israelite warriors to conquer their enemies\nmarched down\nto the city gates\ns people\nYahweh\nThe people came to my house and shouted\nDeborah\nwake up\nWake up\nand start singing\nThey also shouted get up\nBarak\nand capture our enemies\nson of\nAbinoam\nLater\ncame down from the highlands\nsome of the Israelite people who survived the battle\nto where their leaders were\nThese were men who belonged to\nYahweh\nand they came down\nto me\nto fight their enemies alongside these warriors\nSome came from\nthe tribe descended from Ephraim\nThey

shepherds whistle for\ntheir flocks of sheep to come to the pens\nMen in the tribe descended from\nReuben\ncould not decide whether they would join us to fight our enemies or not\nSimilarly the men living in the Gilead area\neast of\nthe Jordan River\nstayed at home\nAnd the men from the tribe descended from Dan\nwhy\ndid they stay home\nThe tribe descended from Asher\nsat\nby\nthe seashore\nin their coves\nThey stayed\nBut men from the tribe descended from Zebulun\nrisked\ntheir lives\non the battlefield\nand men descended from Naphtali\nwere ready to do that also\nfought us\nThe kings

tents in the area\nand then destroyed\nthe crops\nas far south as\nGaza\nnot\nThey did leave\nanything to eat\nfor the Israelites\nand took away the sheep\nthe cattle\nand the donkeys\nThey\nand their livestock\ncame into Israel\nwith their tents\nlike a swarm of\nlocusts\nThere were so many of them that arrived\nriding on their camels\nthat no one could count\nThey stayed\nthe Israelites livelihoods\nso they could ruin\ntook almost everything owned\nthe Israelites\nThe people of Midian\nSo finally pleaded for to help them\nthe Israelites\nYahweh\nWhen\npleaded to help them\nthe Israelites\nwith\nYahweh\nbecause\nof what the people from Midian had done to them\nsent\nYahweh\na prophet\nto\nthem\nwho said\nThis is what\nsays\nYahweh\nthe God of\nIsrael\nI\nbrought\nyour ancestors\nout of Egypt\nout of the places where\nyou all were slaves\nBut I rescued\nthem\nfrom\nthe leaders of Egypt\nand from\nall\nthe others who oppressed you\nI expelled\ntheir enemies\nfrom\nand gave\nto you\nthis land it\nI told\nyou and your ancestors\nI am\nYahweh\nyour God\nbut not\nyou must worship\nthe gods they worship\nof the Amorites\nin which\nYou you\nare now are living\nin the land here in this land\nBut not\nyou did obey\nme\nOne day appeared\nthe angel of\nYahweh\nand sat\nunder\na big oak tree That tree\nat the town of Ophrah\nbelonged\nto Joash\nwho was from the clan of Abiezer\nGideon He\nJoash s son\nwas threshing was threshing\nwheat the grain\nin the pit where they pressed grapes to make wine there\nin order to hide it\nfrom\nthe people of Midian\nwent over\nto Gideon\nYahweh\nand said\nto him\nYahweh\nis helping you\nYou mighty warrior\nreplied\nGideon\nSir\nif is\nYahweh\nhelping us\nwhy\nhave happened to us\nall\nthese bad things\nall\nthe miracles that Yahweh performed for\nheard about heard\nWe We\nour ancestors people\ntell us about how\nfrom being slaves in Egypt\nrescued them\nhe\nBut now has abandoned us\nYahweh\nand we are ruled\nby the people from Midian\nThen turned\ntoward him\nYahweh\nand said\nYou have the strength\nto rescue\nthe Israelites\nfrom\nthe people of Midian\nI am sending you to do that\nGideon replied\nLord\nBut how\ncan I rescue\nthe Israelites\nMy clan is\nthe least significant\nin the whole tribe descended from Manasseh\nand I am\nthe least significant person\nin my whole family\nsaid\nto him\nYahweh\nI will help you\nSo you will defeat\nthe Midianite army\nas easily as if you were fighting only man\none\nGideon replied\nIf\nyou are truly pleased with me\ndo something\nwhich will prove that\nyou are really Yahweh\nwho are speaking\nto me\nBut not\ndo go away\nuntil\nI go\nand bring back\nan offering\nto you\nYahweh answered\nVery well I\nwill stay here\nuntil\nyou return\nGideon\nhurried to his home\nHe killed and cooked\na young goat it\nThen he took a about twenty two liters of\nflour\nand baked some bread without yeast\nthe cooked meat\nThen he put\nin a basket\nthe broth from the meat\nand put\nin a pot\nand took it\nto Yahweh\nwho was sitting under\nthe tree\nThen said\nto him\nthe angel of\nGod\nthe meat\nand\nthe bread\nPut\non\nrock\nthis\nThen\nthe broth\npour on top of it\nSo Gideon did that\nThen reached out\nYahweh\nwith the walking stick\nthat was\nin his hand\nand touched\nthe meat\nand bread\nflamed up\nA fire\nfrom\nthe rock\nand burned up\nthe meat\nand\nthe bread that Gideon had brought\nAnd then\nYahweh\ndisappeared\nWhen realized\nGideon\nthat really\nwho had appeared in the form of an angel and talked with him\nYahweh\nit was\nexclaimed\nhe\nSo I will surely die\nO Yahweh\nI have seen\nwhen you had the form of an angel\nyou\nface\nto\nface\nBut called and said\nto him\nYahweh\nnot\nDo be afraid\nnot\nYou will die\nThen built\nthere\nGideon\nan altar\nto worship Yahweh\nHe named\nit\nYahweh\nis Peace\nThat altar is still\nthere at the town of Ophrah\nin the land of the Abiezrites\nnight\nThat\nsaid\nto Gideon\nYahweh\nTake\nthe bull\nthat\nbelongs to your father\nbull\nsecond best the\nthat is seven\nyears old\nand tear down\nthe altar that\nto worship the god Baal\nyour father built\nAlso\nthe pole for worshiping the goddess Asherah\nthat is\nthere beside it\ncut down\nThen build\na stone altar\nto worship me Yahweh\nyour God\nhere on\nhill\nthis\nTake\nthe meat of the bull\nand make a fire to burn as a burnt offering to me\nthe wood from\nthe Asherah pole\nyou cut down\nSo and\nGideon\nten\nof his servants\ndid\nwhat\nEarly as soon as got up\nthe men\nthe next morning\nthey saw that\nwas in ruins\nthe altar to\nBaal\nand the Asherah pole\nwas gone\nand\nthe bull\nwas what remained from they had sacrificed\non\na altar it\nThey saw that there was new there\nThe people asked\neach other\nWho\ndid\nthis\nAfter they investigated\nsomeone told them that\nit was Gideon\nson of\nJoash\nwho had done\nit\nsaid\nThe men\nof the town\nto\nJoash\nBring out here\nyour son\nHe must be put to death\nbecause\nhe destroyed\ns altar\nour god Baal\nand\ncut down\nthe Asherah pole where we worship\nBut replied\nJoash\nto\nthose who\ncame\nagainst him\nAre you Are you\ntrying to defend trying to argue his case\nBaal\nAnyone\nwho tries to defend\nBaal\nshould be executed\nby\ntomorrow morning\nIf\ntruly a god\nBaal is\nhe ought to be able to defend\nhimself\nwhen\nsomeone tears down\nhis altar\npeople called\nGideon\nFrom time\nthat\nJerub Baal\nwhich means\nshould defend himself\nBaal\nbecause\nhe had torn down\nBaal s altar\nSoon after that the armies of\nthe people of Midian\nand of Amalek\nand the people from\nthe east\ngathered\ntogether\nThey crossed the Jordan River to attack the Israelites\nThey set up their tents\nin the Valley of\nJezreel\nThen s Spirit\nYahweh\ntook control of\nGideon\nHe blew to summon the men to prepare to fight\na ram s horn\nSo came to him\nthe men of the clan of Abiezer\nmessengers to tell their soldiers to come\nHe also sent\nthroughout\nthe tribes descended from Manasseh\nAsher\nZebulun\nand Naphtali\nand all of them came\nThen said\nGideon\nto\nGod\nIf\nyou\nto rescue\nare truly going to enable me\nthe Israelite people\nas\nyou promised\nI\nTonight will put\na dry fleece\nwool\non the ground where I thresh the grain\nTomorrow morning if\ndew\nis wet with\nthe fleece\nbut\nthe ground\nis dry\nthen I will know\nthat\nto rescue\nI am the one you will enable\nthe people of Israel\nas\nyou promised\nAnd that is what happened\nWhen Gideon got up\nthe next morning\nhe picked up\nthe fleece\nand squeezed out\na whole bowlful\nof water\nThen said\nGideon\nto\nGod\nnot\nDo be angry\nwith me\nbut let me ask you\ndo one more thing\nTonight I will put out\nagain\nthe fleece\nThis time\nlet remain dry\nthe fleece\nwhile\nthe ground\nis wet with\nthe dew\nSo did\nGod\nwhat Gideon asked him to do\nnight\nthat\nThe next morning was\ndry\nthe fleece\nbut\nthe ground\nwas covered with\ndew\nThe next morning got up early\nJerub Baal\nhis name is also\nGideon\nand\nhis men\nand went as far as\nthe spring of Harod\nwas camped\nThe army of Midian\nof them\nnorth\nnear the hill of\nMoreh\nin the valley\nsaid\nYahweh\nto\nGideon\nYou have too many\nsoldiers\nwith you\nI allow\nthe army of Midian\nall of you to fight and your army defeats them\nIf\nthey will boast\nto me\nthat they defeated their enemies by themselves without my help\nSo\ntell\nthe men\nWhoever among you\nis timid\nor afraid\nmay leave us\nand depart\nfrom Mount\nGilead\nSo after Gideon told that to them went home\nof\nthem\ntwenty\ntwo\nthousand\nOnly ten\nthousand men\nwere left there\nBut told\nYahweh\nGideon\nThere are still\nmen\ntoo many\nTake them down\nto\nthe spring\nand I will choose from among them\nthere\nwhich ones\nwill go\nwith you\nand\nwhich ones\nnot\nwill go\nWhen Gideon took down\nthe men\nto\nthe spring\ntold\nYahweh\nto\nhim\nthe ones\nwho\nWhen they drink lap\nwith their tongues\nthe water\nlike\ndo\ndogs\nput into one group\nPut into another group the ones\nwho\ndown\nkneel\ndrink with their mouths in the water\nSo when they drank\nused their hands\nto\nbring water to their mouths\nonly three\nhundred\nmen\nAll\nthe others\ndown\nby kneeling and putting their mouths into\ndrank\nthe water\nThen told\nYahweh\nGideon\nThe three will be your army\nhundred\nmen\nwho lapped the water from their hands\nI will help\nthem\ndefeat\nthe Midianite army\nall\nthe others\nLet go\nhome\nSo collected from\nthe food\nGideon s men\nand\nrams horns used as trumpets\nand then\nall\nthe other men\nhe sent\nthem\nhome\nthree\nhundred\nwere camping\nThe men of Midian\nGideon\nbelow\nin the valley\nBut if\nare afraid\nyou by yourself\nto go\ntake\nwith you\nPurah\nyour servant\nGo down and listen to\nwhat\nsome of the Midian soldiers are saying\nThen\nyou will be very encouraged\nand you will be ready to attack\ntheir camp\nSo and they went down\nGideon\ntook Purah with him\nto\nthe edge\nof the enemy camp\nThe armies of the people of Midian\nand Amalek\nand\nfrom\nthe east\nhad set up their tents\nand looked like a swarm of locusts\ntheir camels\nIt seemed that were too many to count\nlike the grains of sand\non\nthe seashore\ncrept closer\nGideon\nand heard\none man\ntelling about\na friend\na dream\nHe said\na dream\nI just had\nand in the dream I saw\na round loaf of\nbread\nbarley\ntumble down\ninto camp\nour Midian\na tent\nIt struck\nso hard that\nturned upside down\nand collapsed\nthe tent\nHis friend\nsaid\nYour dream can mean only one thing\nIt means that\nGideon\nthe man of\nIsrael\nwill enable to defeat\nGod\nall of the armies that are here with us men from Midian\nWhen heard\nGideon\nthe man tell about\nhis dream\nand\nthe meaning of that dream\nhe thanked God\nThen he and Purah returned\nto\nthe camp\nIsraelite\nand he shouted to the men\nGet up\nBecause\nis enabling you\nGod\nto defeat\nthe men from\nMidian\nHe divided into\nhis men\nthree\ngroups\nHe gave He gave\na ram s horn as a trumpet\neach man each of them\nand an clay jar\nempty\nalso a torch to carry\nThen he said\nto them\nme\nWatch\nWhen\nwe\ncome\nclose to\nthe enemy camp the camp\nThen\nexactly what\nI do\ndo\nAs soon as blow\ntheir ram s horns\nmy men\nblow\nyour horns\nyou men\nin the other two groups surrounding\nthe camp\nand shout\nWe are doing this for Yahweh\nand for Gideon\narrived\nGideon\nand the hundred\nmen\nwith him\nat the edge of\nthe Midian camp\nA while before midnight at the start\nof the watch\nmiddle\njust when\na new group of guards took the places of the previous guards\nSuddenly he and his men blew\ntheir horns\nand broke\nthe jars\nthat\nthey were carrying\nThen blew\nthe men in all three\ngroups\ntheir horns\nand smashed\ntheir jars\nThey held high held up\nwith hands\ntheir left\nthe torches\nand with hands\ntheir right\nthe horns\nand alternatively blew them\nand shouted\nWe have swords to fight for\nYahweh\nand for Gideon\nstood\nEach of Gideon s men\nin his position\naround\nthe enemy camp\nAs they watched started running around\nall\nthe Midian men\nand shouting\nWhile kept blowing\nthe three\nhundred Israelite men\ntheir horns\ncaused to start fighting\nYahweh\nwith their swords\nthe Midianites\neach other\nfled fled fled\nThe rest Some Some\nsouth to\nBeth\nShittah\nto the town of Zerarah\nas far as\nthe border of\nAbel\nMeholah\nnear\nTabbath\nThen Gideon sent messages to tell them to come\nto the soldiers in the areas where lived\nthe descendants of Naphtali\nAsher\nand\nManasseh\nand pursue\nthe army of Midian\nmessengers\nsent\nGideon\nthroughout\nthe hill country\nwhere the descendants of Ephraim lived\nsaying\nGo down Go down\nand attack\nthe army of Midian\nto prevent enemy troops from crossing it Station men\nto the places where people can wade across\nas far south as\nBeth\nBarah\nto the Jordan River\nSo\nthe men of\nEphraim\ndid what Gideon told them to do\nThey also captured\nthe two\ngenerals of\nthe Midian army\nOreb\nand\nZeeb\nThey killed\nOreb\nat the big rock\nwhich is now called the rock of Oreb\nand\nZeeb\nthey killed\nat the place where they crush grapes\nthat is now called the winepress of Zeeb\nthe heads of\nOreb\nand Zeeb\nand brought them\nto\nGideon who was\non the other side\nof the Jordan River\nThen said\nto Gideon\nthe soldiers from the tribe of\nEphraim\nWhy like\nthis\nhave you acted\ntoward us\nwhy did you not\ncall to help you\nus\nWhen\nyou went out\nto fight\nagainst the army of Midian\nThey argued\nwith Gideon\nvery much\nBut Gideon replied\nI have done\nvery little compared with what you have done\nare\nmuch better\nThe grapes you do not bother to pick in\nthe land of Ephraim\nthan the whole harvest among\nthe descendants of Abiezer\nhelped you defeat\nGod\nthe generals of\nthe army from Midian\nOreb\nand\nZeeb\nwhat\nI\ndid\nThat is much more important than\nAfter\nthey no longer resented\nwhat he had done\nGideon told them\nthat\nThen went east came\nGideon They\nto the Jordan River\nand crossed it\nhis\nand three\nhundred\nmen\nAlthough they were very tired\nthey continued to pursue their enemies\nWhen they arrived at Gideon said\nto the leaders\nthe town of Succoth town\ngive\nPlease\nbread that they may eat it\nmen\nmy\nare very tired\nThey\nWe\nare pursuing\nZebah\nand Zalmunna\nthe kings of\nMidian\nBut replied\nthe leaders of\nSuccoth\nYou have not caught\nZebah\nand Zalmunna\nyet\nSo why\nshould we give now\nto your troops\nfood\nreplied\nGideon\nBecause you said that\nafter enables us to defeat Zalmunna we will return And\nYahweh\nZebah\nand\nthen we will make whips and with them we will rip\nthe flesh off your bones\nfrom thorns\nfrom the desert\nGideon and his three hundred men went up\nto Peniel\nand asked for food\nthere\nin the same way\nBut gave answer\nhim\nthe people\nthe same\nSo he said\nto the men of\nPeniel\nAfter I defeat those kings\nand make peace\nthen I will come and pull down\ntower\nthis\nBy that time Zebah\nand Zalmunna\nhad gone to Karkor town\ntroops\nwith\nfifteen\nthousand\nThey were all\nthat were left\nof\nthe armies that had come\nfrom the people of\nthe East\nand had already been killed\n120 000 of their\nmen\nwent went past\nGideon and his men They\nalong the road on which travel\ncaravans\neast\nthe villages of Nobah\nand Jogbehah\nand arrived at\nthe enemy camp\nby surprise\nfled\nZebah\nand Zalmunna\nbut Gideon s men pursued\nthem\nHe captured\nthe two\nkings of\nMidian\nZebah\nand\nZalmunna\nand whole\ntheir army\nwas sent off in confusion\nAfter that and his men took Zebah and Zalmunna with them and started to return\nGideon\ngoing through the pass of\nHeres\nThere he captured\na young man The young man\nfrom\nSuccoth\nand demanded\nthat he write down wrote down\nthe names of all of the leaders in\nthe town\nseventy\nseven\nnames\nThen Gideon and his men returned\nto to\nthose leaders\nSuccoth\nand said\nHere are\nZebah\nand Zalmunna\nWhen we were here before\nyou made fun of\nme\nand said\nZebah\nand Zalmunna\nyet\nYou have not caught\nAfter you catch them\nwe will give\nyour men\nexhausted\nsome food\nThen Gideon s men took\nthe leaders\ntown\nfrom the desert\nmade from briers\nand whipped to teach them that they deserved to be punished for not giving them food\nwith whips\nthem\nThen they went and\nthe tower\nto Peniel\ntore down\nand killed\nall the men in\nthe town\nThen Gideon said\nto\nZebah\nand\nZalmunna\nwhat did they look like\nThe men\nyou killed\nnear Mount Tabor\nThey replied\nlike you\nThey were\nthey all\nlooked like\nthey were sons of\na king\nGideon replied\nmy brothers\nThey were\nJust as surely as lives\nYahweh\nif\nyou had not killed\nthem\nnot\nI would kill\nyou\nThen he turned He said\nto Jether to him\nhis oldest son\nKill\nthem\nso not\nhe did pull out to kill them\nJether\nhis sword\nand\nhe was afraid\nBut\nwas only\na boy\nThen said to Gideon\nZebah\nand Zalmunna\nDo not ask a young boy to do the work that a man should do\nSo\nGideon\nkilled\nboth of them\nThen he took\nthe golden crescent shaped ornaments\nfrom\nthe necks of\ntheir camels\nThen came and said\na group of men\nIsraelite\nto to\nGideon him\nbe ruler We want to be rulers\nour our\nYou you\nand\nyour son\nand\nyour grandsons\nbecause\nyou rescued us\nfrom\nthe Midian army\nBut replied\nGideon\nNo not\nwill rule\nI\nover you\nand not\nwill rule\nmy son\nover you\nYahweh\nwill rule\nover you\nThen said\nhe\nI only one thing I\nrequest request\nthat give\nme\neach of you\none earring\nfrom the things you captured after the battle\nNow\nearrings\ngold\nwore\nall the men descended from Ishmael\nThey replied\nWe will be glad to give the earrings to you\nSo they spread on the ground\na cloth\nand threw\non it\neach man\nthe gold earrings that\nhe had taken from those whom he had killed in the battle\nwas\nThe weight of\nall the earrings\ntwenty kilograms\nThat did not include other things that they gave to Gideon\nthe other ornaments\nor the pendants\nor the clothes\nthat wore on\nkings\ntheir\nor\nthe gold chains\nthat were\nthe necks of\ntheir camels\nmade\nGideon\na sacred garment\nand put\nit\nin his hometown of\nOphrah\nSoon worshiped instead of worshiping only God\nfor the people the people\nit\nGideon\nand all his family\nsinned by worshiping it\nThat is how defeated\nthe people from Midian The people of Midian\nthe Israelites\nnot\nagain\ndid become strong enough to attack Israel\nSo there was peace\nin the land\nfor forty\nyears\nwhile was alive\nGideon\nwent\nGideon\nto live there\nback home\nseventy\nsons\nand they bore him\nwives\nmany\nhad\nHe\nHe also had a slave wife\nin the city of Shechem\nbore\nhim\nwho\na son\nwhom he\nnamed\nAbimelech\ndied\nGideon\nson of\nJoash\nwhen he was very old\nThey buried his body\nin the grave where\nJoash was buried\nhis father\nat Ophrah\nin the land of the Abietherites\nBut\nas soon as\ndied\nGideon\nthe Israelites\nleft God and gave themselves to worship like adultresses leave their husbands and go to other men\nthe images of the god Baal\nThey made\nthey worshiped\nBaal\nBerith\nthe god\nforgot about\nThey\nYahweh\nthe one who had rescued\nthem\nfrom\nall\ntheir enemies\nthat surrounded them\nnot\nthey did act\nkindly\ntoward\ns family\nGideon\nAnd even though\nmany good things\nGideon had done\nfor the Israelites\nwent\nAbimelech\ns son\nGideon\nin the city of Shechem\nto talk with\ns brothers\nhis mother\nHe said\nto them\nand to\nall\ns relatives\nhis mother\nAsk\nall\nthe leaders of\nShechem\nDo you think it would be\ngood\nfor\nto rule\nover you\nseventy of\nall\ns sons\nGideon\nOr would it be better to have\nto rule\nover you\nman Abimelech\nonly one\nAnd do not forget\nthat\na part of your family\nI am\nSo spoke\ns brothers\nAbimelech s mother\nto about what Abimelech had said\nto each other\nall\nthe leaders of\nShechem\nWe should allow to rule over us\nAbimelech\nbecause\nThey said\nour relative\nhe is\nSo the leaders of Shechem took and gave\nto Abimelech\none kilo of silver it\nfrom the temple of\ntheir god Baal\nBerith\nWith that silver paid to help him\nhe\nsome worthless troublemakers\nand they went with wherever went\nAbimelech he\nAbimelech and his followers went\ns town\nhis father\nto Ophrah\nand they murdered They killed\nhis brothers\nthe sons of\nhis father Gideon\nseventy\nall those men\non\nhuge rock\none\nBut and he escaped\nJotham\ns son\nGideon\nyoungest\nhid from Abimelech and his men\nThen gathered\nall\nthe leaders of\nthe towns of Shechem\nand\nBeth\nMillo\nThere they appointed\nAbimelech\nto be their leader\nunder\nthe tree\nbig sacred\nat Shechem\nWhen heard about that\nJotham\nhe climbed up\nHe stood\nat the top of\nMount the mountain\nGerizim\nand shouted\nto the people down below\nlisten\nto me\nYou leaders of\nShechem\nin order that will listen\nto you\nGod\nOne day\ndecided\nthe trees\nto appoint to rule\nover all of them\na king\nSo they said\nto the olive tree\nBut said\nthe olive tree\nI will not stop producing\nolives from which we make that oil\nThe oil made from my fruit\nblesses\nboth God\nand people\nin order\nto rule\nover\nyou other trees\nThen said\nthe trees\nto the fig tree\ncome\nYou\nand be king\nour\nBut replied\nthe fig tree\nNo I do not want to stop producing\nmy sweet\nfruit\ngood\nand go\nand rule\nover\nyou other trees\nThen said\nthe trees\nto the grapevine\nCome\nour\nBut replied\nthe grapevine\nThe new wine that is made from my grapes\ncauses to be happy\nGod\nand people\nI do not want to stop producing grapes and go\nand rule\nover\nyou other trees\nThen said\nall\nthe trees\nto\nthe thornbush\nCome\nand be king\nour\nsaid\nThe thornbush\nto\nthe trees\nIf\ntruly\nyou\nwant to appoint\nme\nto be king\nyour\ncome\ninto the shade of my tiny branches\nBut if\nyou do not want to do that\nI hope that will come out\nfire\nfrom\nme\nand burn up\nall the cedar trees in\nLebanon country\nAfter Jotham finished telling them this parable he said So now\nI ask you\nbeing completely honest\nand sincere\nwere you\nwhen you appointed to be your king\nAbimelech\nNo\nHave you rewarded by honoring him\nGideon who is also called Jerub Baal\nas he deserved because of all the good things he did for you\nDo not forget that\nfought a battle\nmy father\nfor you\nand he was willing to die for you if that were necessary\nto save\nyou\nfrom the power of\nthe Midian people group\nBut you\nhave rebelled\nagainst\ns family\nmy father\nnow\nand you have murdered\nof his sons\nseventy\non\nhuge rock\none\nAnd you have appointed\nAbimelech\nwho is the son of\nmy father s slave girl\nnot the son of his wife to be the king who will rule\nyou people of\nShechem\nYou have done that only because\none of your relatives\nhe is\nSo if you think that\ntruly\nfairly and sincerely\nyou have acted\ntoward\nGideon\nand\nhis family\ntoday\nI hope that will cause you to be happy\nAbimelech\nand that will cause to be happy\nhim\nyou\nBut if\nwhat you did was not right\nI wish that\nAbimelech\nwill destroy\nShechem\nand\nBeth\nMillo\nI wish that\nthe leaders of\nShechem\nand Beth\nMillo\nwill also destroy\nAbimelech\nAfter finished saying that he escaped from them\nJotham\nand ran away\nto the town of Beer\nHe stayed\nthere\nbecause he was afraid that would try to kill him\nAbimelech\nhis half brother\nwas the leader\nAbimelech\nover\nthe people of Israel\nFor three\nyears\nThen sent\nGod\nan spirit\nevil\nto cause trouble between\nAbimelech\nand\nthe leaders of\nShechem\nwith the result that rebelled\nthe leaders of\nShechem\nagainst Abimelech\nSo now God sent the evil spirit to punish\nseventy of all of them\ns sons\nGideon\nfor what they had done\nThe leaders of\nShechem\nhad helped\nAbimelech\nmurder\nwho were his half brothers\nset\nThe leaders of\nShechem\nan ambush\non\nthe hilltops\nThose men robbed\neveryone\nwho\npassed by\nBut someone told about it so he did not go near them\nAbimelech\nThere was\na man named Gaal\nson of\nEbed\nalong with his brothers\nwho moved into\nShechem city\ngrew to trust\nhim\nThe leaders of\nShechem\nThey went out to\nto pick some grapes\ntheir vineyards\nThey pressed the grapes to make juice\nand then they made\nwine\nThen they had a feast in\nthe house of\ntheir god\nand they ate a lot of food\nand drank a lot of wine\nThen they cursed\nAbimelech\nsaid\nGaal\nWe should not allow\nAbimelech\nto rule over us\nHe is only one of so he really does not belong to us\ns sons\nGideon\nAnd Zebul the governor of our city\nhe appointed to be his deputy\nWe should be loyal to\none of the descendants of\nHamor\nthe founder of\nour city\nnot\nto be leader Abimelech\nour\nIf\nyou would appoint me to be your leader\nI would get rid of\nAbimelech\nI would say\nto him\nGet ready\nyour army\nCome and fight us\nSomeone told\nZebul\nwhat had said\nand he became very angry\nHe sent\nmessengers\nto\nAbimelech\nThey told him\nGaal\nand his brothers\nhave come\nto Shechem\nhere and\nthey are stirring up so they will rebel\nthe people\nagainst you\nshould\nget up\nduring the night\nYou\nand your men\nand go and hide\nin the fields outside the city\nin the

all\nthe men\nwho were\nwith him\nduring the night\nand hid in the fields\nnear Shechem\nfour\nThey divided into groups\nThe next morning went out\nGaal\nand stood\nat the entrance to\ngate\nthe

from\nJephthah\ncontained in this message\nThen took control of\nJephthah\nthe Spirit of\nYahweh\nJephthah went through to enlist men for his army\nGilead\nand through\nthe area where the tribe of

saw\nhis daughter\nhe tore to show that he was very sad about what he was going to do\nhis clothes\nHe said to her\nMy daughter\nseeing you now you have crushed me with a terrible sorrow\nbecause I\nmade a solemn promise to sacrifice the first one who came out of my house\nto\nYahweh\nand must\nI\ndo what I promised\nHis daughter said\nMy father\nyou made a solemn promise\nto\nYahweh\nSo you

allow\nme\nfor two\nmonths\nto go\nand wander around\ninto\nthe hills\nallow to go and cry together\nSince I will never be married and have children\nme\nJephthah replied\nAll right you may go\nSo left\nshe\nfor two\nmonths\nShe\nand her friends\nand they cried\nfor her because she would never be married\nstayed in\nthe hills\nAfter\ntwo\nmonths\nshe returned\nto\nher father Jephthah\nand he did\nto her\nwhat he had solemnly promised\nSo his daughter\nnever\nwas married\nBecause of that\nnow have a custom\nthe Israelites\nevery\ngo into the hills\nthat the young women\nIsraelite\nThere they remember and cry about what happened\nto the daughter of\nJephthah\nfor four\ndays\nyear\ncalled together their soldiers\nThe leaders of the tribe of\nEphraim\nand they crossed the Jordan River and went\nto the town of Zaphon\nto talk They said\nwith Jephthah to him\nWhy\nto help your army fight\nthe Ammonites\nus\nnot\ndid you ask\nyour house\nSo we will burn down\nwhile you are in

I saw\nthat\nnot\nyou would come to help us\nI risked my own life\nby leading our people to pass through\nthe people of\nAmmon\nAnd helped us\nYahweh\nto defeat them\nSo why\ndo you come\ntoday\nto fight\nagainst me\nThen called together\nJephthah\nthe soldiers of\nGilead\nto fight against\nthe soldiers of Ephraim\nattacked\nThey\nthem\nbecause\nmen of the tribe of Ephraim said\njust

men\non day\nthe seventh\nbefore\nsunset\nNothing is\nsweeter\nthan honey\nNothing is\nas strong as\na lion\nSamson replied\nPeople use their own animals to plow their fields My bride is like a young heifer that you have used but she does not belong to you If you had not forced her to ask me\nnot\nyou would have learned the answer\nThen powerfully came\non Samson\ns Spirit\nYahweh\nHe went down\nto the coast at the city of Ashkelon\nand killed\nthirty\nmen\nHe took\ntheir clothes\nand went back to Timnah then he gave\nthem\nto the men at the feast\nBut he was very angry about what had happened\nso he went back\nhome to live with his mother and father\nSo his wife s father gave instead\nher\nto the man who had been Samson s special friend when he got married\nDuring the time\nthat they were harvesting\nthe wheat\ntook to Timnah\nSamson\nhis wife\na young goat as a present for\nHe wanted to sleep with his wife\nbut not\nwould let him\nher father\ngo into her room\nsaid to Samson\nHe\nreally\nI thought\nthat\nyou hated her\nSo I gave her\nto the man who was your best friend at the wedding and she has married him\nBut look\nher sister\nyounger\nis more beautiful\nthan she is\nTake\nher instead\nreplied\nSamson\nNo I have a right\nAnd this time\nyou Philistines\nto get revenge on\nThen went out into the fields\nhe\nand caught\nthree\nhundred\nfoxes\nHe tied\ntheir tails together\nHe fastened\ntorches\nto each\ntwo by two\npair of tails\nThen he lit\nthe torches\nand let the foxes run through\nthe fields of\nthe Philistines\nThe fire from the torches burned\nall the grain to the ground including the grain that had been cut and stacked in bundles\nThe fire also burned down\ntheir grapevines\nand their olive trees\nasked\nThe Philistines\nWho\ndid\nthis\nSomeone told them\nSamson did it\nHe married a woman from Timnah\nbut then\nhis father in law\ngave her\nto the man who was Samson s best friend at the wedding and she married him\nSo went to Timnah\nthe Philistines\nand got and burned them to death\nthe woman\nand\nher father\nfound out about that and said\nto them\nSamson\nBecause\nyou have done\nthis\nI will get revenge\non you\nand then\nI will be happy\nSo he\nattacked the Philistines\nfuriously\nand killed many of them\nThen he went\nto hide\nin a cave in\nthe large rock at\na place called Etam\ndid not know where he was so went up\nThe Philistines they\nto where the descendants of Judah lived\nand they arranged themselves for battle\nat the town of Lehi\nasked the Philistines\nThe men\nthere\nWhy\ndo you want to attack\nus\nThe Philistines replied\nWe have come to capture\nSamson\nWe have come\nto get revenge\non him\nfor what\nhe did\nto us\nSomeone there knew where Samson was hiding So went down to get Samson\nthree\nthousand\nmen\nfrom Judah\nat\nthe cave in\nthe rock where\nhe was hiding\nThey said\nto Samson\nnot\nDo you realize\nthat\nare ruling\nover us\nthe people of Philistia\nDo you not realize what they will do\nto us\nSamson replied\nfor what\nthey did\nto me\nThe only thing I did was that\nI got revenge\non them\nBut the men from Judah said\nto him\nto tie you up\nWe have come\nand put you\nin the hands of\nthe Philistines\nsaid\nSamson\nAll right but promise\nme\nthat\nyou will not kill\nme\nyourselves\nThey replied\nWe will just tie you up\nand take you\nto the Philistines\nnot\nWe will kill you\nSo they tied him\nwith two\nropes\nnew\nand led him away\nfrom\nthe cave\nWhen they\narrived\nat\nLehi\nthe Philistines\ncame toward him shouting\ntriumphantly\nBut powerfully came\non Samson\ns Spirit\nYahweh\nthe ropes\non\nhis arms\nas easily as if they had been stalks of flax\nburned\nHe snapped and fell off\nthey\nhis wrists\nThen he saw lying on the ground\na s jawbone\ndonkey\nIt was new so it was hard\nHe picked it up\nand killed\nwith it\nabout a thousand\nPhilistine men\nThen wrote this poem\nSamson\nWith jawbone of\nthe a donkey\nI have made them like a heap of dead donkeys\nWith jawbone of\nthe a donkey\nI have killed\na thousand\nmen\nWhen he finished\nhe threw away\nthe jawbone\nbut later was called\nplace\nthat\nRamath Lehi or Jawbone Hill\nThen Samson was thirsty\nvery\nso he called out\nto\nYahweh\nYou\nhave given\nstrength\nme\nto win a victory\ngreat\nSo now\nmust I die\nbecause of being thirsty\nwith the result that will capture me\nthose heathen uncircumcised Philistines\nSo caused\nGod\na depression in the ground\nat Lehi\nto gush out of\nwater\nSamson drank from it\nand soon felt strong again\nHe named that place\nEn Hakkore or The spring of the one who called out\nThat spring can still be found\nat Lehi\neven today\nSamson was the leader and judge over\nIsrael\nbut during that time were in control of the entire land\nthe Philistines\nfor twenty\nyears\nwent to\nSamson\nthe city of Gaza\nHe saw\nthere\na prostitute\nand he spent the night\nwith her\nThe Gazites\nwere told\nhas come\nSamson\nhere\nThey surrounded the place where Samson was\nand they waited in secret\nall\nnight\nThey were beside gate so they would be sure he could not escape\nthe city\nThey said\nLet us wait until\nthe light\nand then we will kill him\nBut did stay there\nSamson\nnot all night\nhe got up\nAt midnight\nHe went to he took hold of\ngate\nthe city\nits two\nposts\nand he lifted them up out of the ground\nwith\nits connecting cross bar still attached\nHe put it\non\nhis shoulders\nand carried it\nmany miles uphill\nin front of\nthe town of Hebron\nLater\nSamson fell in love with\na woman\nShe lived in the Valley of\nSorek in the Philistine area\nnamed\nDelilah\nwent\nto her\nThe leaders\nPhilistine\nand said\nUse your tricks\nfrom Samson\nto find out\nwhat makes him\nstrong\nso\nAnd find out how\nwe can subdue\nhim\nand tie him up securely\nIf you do that\nwill give\nyou\neach of us\n1\n100\npieces of silver\nSo went and said\nDelilah\nto\nSamson\ntell\nPlease\nme\nwhat makes\nyou strong\nso\nand tell me how\nsomeone can subdue you and tie you up\nsaid\nSamson\nIf\nsomeone ties me\nwith seven\nbowstrings\nnew\nones that\nnot\nare dry yet\nI will become as weak\nas\nother men\nSo after Delilah told that to brought\nto Delilah\nthe leaders they\nPhilistine\nseven\nbowstrings\nnew\nThen she hid the leaders\nin one of the rooms in her house\nShe tied Samson up with the bowstrings and then called out\nThe Philistines\nhave come here to capture you\nSamson\nBut Samson snapped\nthe bowstrings\nas easily as though\nthey had been strings\nthat had been singed in\na fire\nSo not\nthe Philistines did find out\nwhat made Samson so strong\nThen said\nDelilah\nto\nSamson\nYou have deceived\nme\nand lied\nto me\nNow\ntell\nme\nthe truth how\nsomeone can tie you up securely\nSamson replied\nIf\nsomeone ties me\nwith ropes\nnew\nones that\nnever\nhave been used\nI will be as weak\nas\nother men\nAnd again while Samson was sleeping took\nshe\nthe ropes\nnew\nand tied him up\nwith them\nand then called out\nThe Philistines\nhave come to capture you\nSamson\nSo again she told the Philistine leaders and then came\nand hid as they did before\nin the room\nBut Samson snapped the ropes\non\nhis arms\nas easily as if they had been threads\nThen said\nDelilah\nagain\nYou have deceived\nme\nand lied\nto me\nPlease tell\nme\nhow\nsomeone can tie you up securely\nSamson replied\nIf\nyou weave\nthe seven\nbraids of\nmy hair\ninto\nthe threads you are weaving on the loom and then fasten those threads with a nail that makes the threads tight then I will become as weak as other men So again Delilah held the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the threads on the loom\nand she secured them\nwith a pin\nThen she called out\nThe Philistines\nhave come to capture you\nSamson\nBut Samson woke up\nand pulled away his hair\ntaking with it the pin of\nthe loom\nand\nthe fabric in the loom\nThen Delilah said\nto him\nHow\ncan you say\nthat you love me\nwhen you do not tell me the truth about yourself\nthree\ntimes\nYou have deceived\nme\nand still not\nyou have told\nme\nwhat really makes you\nstrong\nso\nshe used every trick\nDay after day\nto get him to tell her his secret\nHe thought he from her nagging\nwould die\nFinally Samson told\nher\nthe truth\nHe\nhas been cut\nAnd because of that\nhave been set apart for\nGod\nI\nsince the day I was born\nmy hair were shaved off\nwould be gone\nmy strength\nand I would be as weak\nas\nother\nmen\nrealized\nDelilah\nthat this time\nhe had told\nher\nthe truth\nSo she called together\nthe leaders\nPhilistine\nsaying\nCome back\none more time\nbecause finally\nSamson has told\nthe secret about his strength\nSo returned\nthe leaders\nPhilistine\nand gave Delilah\nthe money\nthey promised to give her\nAgain she lulled Samson to sleep\nwith his head in\nher lap\nThen she called\none of the Philistine men\nto come and cut off\nSamson s hair\nAs he did that\nSamson became weak he had no more strength\nThen after she tied him up she called out\nThe Philistines\nhave come to capture you\nSamson\nHe woke up\nand thought\nI will do as I did before\nI will shake these ropes off myself and be free\nBut he\nnot\ndid realize\nthat\nYahweh\nhad left\nhim\nSo seized him\nthe Philistine men\nand gouged out\nhis eyes\nThen they took\nhim\nto Gaza\nand bound him\nwith bronze chains\nThey made him\nturn a large millstone to grind grain every day\nThere they put him in prison\nBut started\nhis hair\nto grow again\nafter\nit had been cut\nSeveral months later the leaders\nPhilistine\ncelebrated a big festival\nDuring the festival they offered\nsacrifices\nto Dagon\ntheir god\nThey praised him\nsaying\nhas enabled\nOur god\nus to defeat\nSamson\nour great enemy\nWhen saw\nSamson\nthe other people\nthey also praised\ntheir god Dagon\nsaying\nhas put helped us\nOur god Our god\ninto our hands to capture\nour great enemy\nthe one who has harmed\nour country\nso much\nBy that time\nthe people were half drunk\nThey shouted\nBring out of the prison Bring here\nSamson him\nso he can entertain\nus\nSo they brought\nSamson\nfrom the prison\nand made him stand in the center of the temple\nThey made stand\nhim\nbetween\nthe two pillars that held up the roof\nsaid\nSamson\nto\nthe servant\nwho was leading him\nby his hand\nthe two pillars\nI want to rest\nagainst them\nAt that time the temple\nwas full of\nmen\nand women\nwere also there\nAll\nthe leaders\nPhilistine\nAnd on\nthe roof\nthere were about three\nthousand\npeople\nwatching\nand making fun of\nSamson him\nprayed\nSamson\nto\nYahweh\nand he said\nLord\nYahweh\nthink about me again\nPlease\ngive me strength\nonly\nonce more\nthis\nso that I may get revenge on\nfor gouging out my eyes\nthe Philistines\nThen put his hands on\nSamson\nthe two\npillars\ncenter\nof\nthe temple\none pillar\nhis right hand on\nand the other one\nhis left hand on\nThen shouted to God\nhe\nLet die\nme\nwith\nthe Philistines\nHe pushed\nwith all his strength\nThe pillars collapsed and crashed down\nthe temple\non\nthe Philistine leaders\nand\nall\nthe other Philistine people and they all died\nSo\nSamson killed\nwhen he died\nmore people\nthan\nhe had killed\nall during his life\nLater went down from Zorah to Gaza\nhis brothers\nand\ntheir relatives\nto get\nhis body\nThey took it back home\nand buried\nit\nbetween\nZorah\nand\nEshtaol\nat the place where was buried\nManoah\nSamson s father\nNow Samson\nhad led\nIsrael\nfor twenty\nyears\nThere was\na man\nwho lived in the hill country where\nthe tribe of Ephraim live\nnamed\nMicah\nOne day he said\nto his mother\neleven hundred\npieces of silver\nwhoever\nstole\nfrom your house\nyou curse\nI heard\nand still have\nit\nI\nI am the one who\ntook the silver\nreplied\nHis mother\nI pray that will bless you\nMy son\nYahweh\nMicah gave back\nall\nthe silver\nto his mother\nThen said to herself And said\nshe she\nI will give\nsome of this silver\nto Yahweh\nto her son My son\nI want you to make from this silver\nan idol\nand a statue\nSo\nI will give some of this silver back\nto you for making these things\nAfter he had given back\nthe silver\nto his mother\ntook\nshe\ntwo hundred\npieces\nand gave them\nto a metal worker\nWith the silver that man made\na carved figure\nand a cast metal figure\nand gave them to Micah put them in\nhouse\nMicah his\nHe\nhad\na house\nin which he worshiped his idols\nHe made\na kind of vest that was worn by priests\nand some smaller personal idols\nand Micah gave the task\none\nof his sons\nof being\nfor all his idols\nthe priest\nAt time\nthat\ndid not have\na king\nIsrael\nand everyone\nwas okay\nwhatever they each decided\ndid\nThere was\na young man\nwho had been living in town of Bethlehem\nwhich is in the area where the tribe of Judah lives\nHe wanted to work as a priest because he was\na member of the tribe of Levi\nSo left\nhe\nBethlehem\nto find another place to live and work\nHe came\nin the hill country\nwhere the tribe of Ephraim lived\nto\ns house\nMicah\nasked\nhim\nMicah\nWhere from\nare you\nHe replied\nfrom the tribe of Levi\nI am\nI come from Bethlehem\nand I\nam looking for a place to live and work as a priest\nsaid\nto him\nMicah\nStay\nwith me\nand you can advise me\nand be my priest\nI\nwill give\nto you\nten\npieces of silver\nEach year\nand some new clothes\nAnd I will provide food for you\nSo agreed\nthe young man\nMicah\nbecame\nlike one\nof Micah s own sons\nappointed\nMicah\nhim\nto be\na priest\nand he lived\nin s house\nMicah\nThen said\nMicah\nNow\nI know\nthat\nwill do good things\nYahweh\nfor me\nbecause\nhave\nI\na man from the tribe of Levi\nto be my priest\nAt time\nthat\nhad no\nking\nthe Israelites\nThe tribe of\nDan\nwas looking for\nfor them\na good place\nto settle down\nbut\nnot\nhad been able to do that\nthe tribe of Dan\nThe other tribes\nIsraelite\nhad been able to receive the land that had been allotted to them\nSo chose\nthey\nfrom their clans\nfive\nsoldiers\nmen\nwho lived in the cities of Zorah\nand Eshtaol\nto go through\nthe land\nand explore it and try to find some land where their tribe could live\nto\nThey came\nin the hill country\nwhere the tribe of Ephraim lived\ns house\nMicah\nand they stayed that night\nthere\nWhile they were\nin\nhouse\nhis\nwhen they heard\nthey recognized him\ntalking from his accent\nthe young man\nwho had become Micah s priest\nSo they went\nto him\nand asked\nhim\nWho\nbrought you\nhere\nWhat\nyou\nare doing\nhere\nWhy\ndid you come\nhere\nHe told And he said\nthem\nthe things that Micah\nhad done\nfor him\nMicah\nhas hired me\nand I have become\nhis\npriest\nSo they said\nto him\nask\nPlease\nGod\nif we will succeed in\nthis journey\nwhat we are trying to do on\nreplied\nThe young man\nGo\nin the knowledge that\nYahweh\non this journey\nwill be\nwith you\nThen left\nfive\nthe men\nWhen they came\nto the city of Laish\nthey saw that\nthe people\nthere\nlived\nsafely\nas the people did in\nthe city of Sidon\nThe people there thought that they were safe\nbecause there was no one\nnearby to cause trouble\nfor them\nfar\nthey were\nfrom Sidon\nand they had contact\nrarely\nwith\nany outsiders\nWhen those five men returned\nto\nZorah\nand Eshtaol\nasked\nthem\ntheir relatives\nWhat\ndid you find out\nThey replied\nWe should go\nand attack the people who live there\nWe have found\nsome land\nand it is\ngood\nvery\nWhy are you staying here and doing nothing\nnot\nDo wait any longer\nWe should go immediately\nand take possession of\nthat land\nWhen you go there\nyou will see that\nThe people there\nare not expecting anyone to attack them\nof land\nthere is plenty\ncertainly\nis giving that land\nGod\nto us\nand it has everything that we will need\nSo left\nfrom the tribe of\nDan\nZorah\nand Eshtaol\nsix\nhundred\nmen\ncarrying\ntheir weapons\nOn their way\nthey set up their tents\nnear the city of Kiriath\nJearim\nin the area where the tribe of Judah live\nThat is why\nwas named\nMahaneh or the Camp of\nDan Dan\nand that is still its name\nthe area west of\nKiriath\nJearim\nthey went to\nFrom there\nthe hill country\nwhere the tribe of Ephraim lived\nAnd they arrived\nat\ns house\nMicah\nfive\nThe men\nwho had explored\nthe land\nnear Laish\nsaid\nto\ntheir fellow Israelites\nDo you know\nthat\nthere is\nin one of houses\nthese\na sacred vest\nseveral household idols\na carved figure\nand a cast metal figure\nWe think that you know\nwhat you should\ndo\nto\nthe house\nwhere the man lived\nfrom the tribe of Levi\nwhich was the house where\nMicah lived\nand they greeted\nthe young man from the tribe of Levi who was Micah s priest\nThe six\nhundred\nmen\ncarrying\ntheir weapons\nstood\noutside\nthe gate of the house\nof the tribe of\nDan\nwent\nfive\nThe men\nwho had explored\nthe land\ninto\nMicah s house\nand took\nthe carved figure\nthe sacred vest\nthe household gods\nand\nthe cast metal figure\nWhile they did that the priest\nstood talking with\noutside\nthe gate\nsix\nhundred\nthe men\nWhen saw them\nbringing out\nthe carved figure\nthe sacred vest\nthe household gods\nand\ncast metal figure\nand he said\nto them\nthe priest\nWhat\nyou\nare doing\nThey replied\nBe quiet\nDo not say anything\nYou come\nwith us\nand be\nto us\nlike a father\nand a priest for us\nIs it better\nfor you to stay here and be\na priest\nfor the people in the house of\nman\none\nor\nto be\na priest a priest\nfor a whole tribe\nfor a clan and\nof Israelites\nliked what they were suggesting\nThe priest\nSo he took\nthe sacred vest\nand the household gods\nand the carved figure\nand he prepared to go with\nthe people\nto travel\nAll the men made\ntheir wives and little children\ntheir animals\nand everything else that they owned\njust in front of themselves\nAfter they\nhad gone a little distance Micah saw what was happening\nfrom s house\nMicah\nthe men\nwho\nlived\nnear\nhim\nHe quickly summoned\nand they ran and caught up with\nthe men from the tribe of\nDan\nThey shouted\nat them\nThe men of the tribe of\nDan\nturned\naround\nand said\nto Micah\nWhat\nis the problem\nWhy\nhave you gathered these men to pursue us\nMicah shouted\nthe silver idols\nthat\nwere made for me\nYou took\nalso\nmy priest\nYou took\nI do not have anything left\nSo why\ndo you ask\nme\nWhat\nis the problem\nreplied\nThe men from the tribe of\nDan\nbetter not\nYou say anything about this matter\nand attack\nyou\nSome of our men\nmight become angry\nkilling you\nand your family\nThen walking\nthe men from the tribe of\nDan\ncontinued\nrealized\nMicah\nthat\nthere was a very large group of them so that it would be useless for him to try to fight them\nSo he turned around\nand went home\nThe men of the tribe of Dan\nwere carrying the things\nthat\nhad been made for\nMicah\nand they also took\npriest\nhis\nand they continued traveling\nto\nLaish\nthe people\nwho were peacefully living there\nThey attacked and killed\nthem\nwith their swords\nThen\neverything in the city\nthey burned\nThere was no\ngroup of people to rescue the people of Laish\nfar so the people who lived there could not help the people of Laish\nLaish was\nfrom Sidon\nAnd other allies\nhad no\nthe people of Laish\nLaish was\nin a valley\nnear the town of Beth\nRehob\nThe people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt\nthe city\nand started to live\nthere\nThey gave to they called\na new name\nthe city it\nDan\nin honor of\nwhose name was Dan\ntheir

of\nGershom\nand the grandson of\nHis descendants\nwas appointed to be continued to be\ntheir priest priests\nuntil\nthe Israelites were captured and taken away\nAfter the people of the tribe of Dan set up\nthe carved figure\nfor Micah\nthat\nhad been made\nand it stayed there as long as\nwas\nthe house of\nGod\nin Shiloh\nAt that time\nking\nhad no\nthe Israelite people\nThere was\na man\nfrom the tribe of Levi\nwho lived\nin a remote place in\nthe hill country where\nthe tribe of Ephraim lives\nHe had previously taken\nto live with him\na woman\nwho was a slave\nShe was from Bethlehem\nin the area where the tribe of Judah lives\nBut started to sleep with other men also\nshe\nThen she left\nhim\nand returned to\ns house\nher father\nin\nBethlehem\nShe stayed\nthere\nfor

has happened\nin Israel\nBut no\nthe people of the tribe of Benjamin\npaid attention to\ntheir fellow Israelites\nand gathered\nThe men of\nthe tribe of Benjamin\nleft\ntheir cities\nat Gibeah\nto fight\nthe other Israelites\nrecruited\nthe men of\nthe tribe of Benjamin\nIn one day\nthat\ntwenty\nsix\nthousand\nmen\nfighting\nThey also chose\nfrom\nGibeah\nseven\nhundred\nmen\nFrom

soldiers of\nIsrael\nnumbered\nnot including the soldiers from\nBenjamin\n400\n000\nmen\nwere trained to fight with\nthe sword\nAll of\nthese\nmen experienced at\nfighting in war\nwent up to\nBethel\nand asked advice\nfrom God\nThose other Israelites\nWhich\nshould\ntribe\nbe the first\nto attack\nthe men from the tribe of\nBenjamin\nanswered\nYahweh\nThe men from the tribe of Judah\nshould go first\nwent\nthe men\nIsraelite\nThe next morning\nand set up their tents\nnear\nGibeah\nThen went\nthey\nto fight\nagainst\nthe men from the tribe of Benjamin\nand stood in their

that\ntwo\ntwenty\nthousand\nsoldiers\nBut encouraged themselves\nthe soldiers of\nIsrael\nThen\nthey got ready\nto fight the next day\nin the same battle lines\nas\non day\nthe first\nThen came together\nthey\nand begged for help\nYahweh\nthey prayed until\nevening\nThey asked advice about what they should do\nfrom Yahweh\nagain\nShould\nwe go\nto fight against\nthe people of\nBenjamin\nour

cried\nthey sat down\nThere\nto\nYahweh\nand they fasted\nit was\nuntil\nevening\nThey brought\nsome offerings which they burned completely on the altar\nand they also brought some offerings to restore fellowship\nwith\nYahweh\nasked\nThe people of\nIsrael\nYahweh\nfor was there\nthe ark of\nthe covenant of\nGod\nin days\nthose\nand Phinehas\nson of\nEleazar\nwas the grandson of\nAaron\nhe

will help you defeat them\nset up\nIsraelite men\nan ambush\nin\nGibeah\nthe fields around\nwent\nThe other Israelite men\nand stood in their positions for fighting a battle\njust as they had done\non the previous days\nWhen came out of the city\nthe men of the tribe of\nBenjamin\nto fight against\nthem\nthe Israelite men retreated and the men of the tribe of Benjamin pursued them\naway from\nthe city\nThe men of the tribe of Benjamin\nmany Israelites\nkilled\nlike\nthey had done before\nand on the roads\none of the roads\nwent\nto Bethel\nand another road went to\nGibeah\nThey killed who died in the fields\nabout thirty\nIsraelites\nsaid\nThe men of\nthe tribe of Benjamin\nare defeating\nthem\nWe\nlike we did before\nBut then men\nIsraelite\ndid what they had planned\nThe main group of Israelite men retreated a short distance\nto trick the men of Gibeah\nfrom\nthe city\nand cause them to pursue the Israelite men\nalong the roads outside the city\nThe main group of\nmen\nIsraelite\nleft their positions and retreated\nand then they stood in their battle positions again\nat a place named Baal\nTamar\nThen the soldiers of who had been hiding in secret places\nIsrael\nran out\nfrom their places\nin Maareh\nGibeah\nThen came out from the places where they had been hiding west of Gibeah\nand attacked\nthe city\nthe other ten\nthousand Israelites\nThey were men\nwho had come from all parts of\nIsrael\nThere was a very big battle\nBut the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nnot\ndid know\nthat\nthey were about to have a disastrous defeat\nenabled to defeat\nYahweh\nthe men of the tribe of Benjamin\nthe Israelite men\nkilled\nThey\n25\n100\nof them\nall of\nthem\nwere fighting men\nSo saw\nthe soldiers of\nBenjamin\nthey were defeated\nhad allowed to advance\nThe men of\nIsrael\nthe Benjamites\nbecause\nthey were relying\non\nthe men they had placed in hidden positions to go out and shift the battle in their favor\noutside\nGibeah\nThen the men who were hiding\ngot up and hurried\nand they rushed\ninto\nGibeah\nand they killed\neveryone who lived in\nthe city\nwith their swords\nNow the arranged signal\nwould be\nbetween the soldiers of\nIsrael\nand\nthe men hiding in secret\nthat a great\nwould rise up\ncloud of\nsmoke\nout of\nthe city\nBy that time had turned away\nthe men\nIsraelite\nfrom attacking\nso the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nsaid\nWe are winning\nthe battle as\nwe did before\nBut then\nbegan\nto rise up\nfrom the burning buildings from\nthe city\nsmoke\nand saw\nThe men of the tribe of Benjamin\nturned around\nthat\nwas burning\nwhole\nthe city\nThen the main group of men\nIsraelite\nalso saw the smoke and they knew that the smoke signaled that they should turn around and begin to attack\nwere very afraid\nThe men of\nthe tribe of Benjamin\nbecause\nthey realized\nthat\nthey were about to have a disastrous defeat\nSo the men of the tribe of Benjamin tried to run away\nto escape from\nthe men\nIsraelite\ntoward\nthe wilderness\nbut they were not able to escape\nbecause the Israelite men who had burned the two cities\ncame out of those cities\nand killed\nmany of them\nThey surrounded\nsome of the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nand pursued the others\nto\nGibeah\nthe area east of\nThey killed\nof the tribe of Benjamin\neighteen\nthousand\nsoldiers\nstrong\nThen the rest of the men of the tribe of Benjamin realized that they had been defeated\nThey ran\ntoward\nrock of\nthe Rimmon\nbut the Israelite men killed\nwho fell behind along the roads\nfive\nthousand\nmore men of the tribe of Benjamin\nThey pursued\nthe rest of them\nto\nGidom\nand they killed\ntwo thousand\nmore\nthere were\nAltogether\nwho were killed\nof the tribe of Benjamin\ntwenty\nfive\nthousand\nmen\nwere fighting\nall of\nthem\nmen\nexperienced\nBut\nran\nin the wilderness\nto\nrock of\nthe Rimmon\nsix\nhundred\nmen of the tribe of Benjamin\nThey stayed for\nthere\nfour\nmonths\nThen men\nthe Israelite\nwent back\nto\nthe land belonging to the tribe of\nBenjamin\nand killed They also killed and destroyed\nthe people in every city\nall\nthe animals\neverything else\nthat they found there\nAnd\nall\nthe cities\nthat they came to\nthey burned\nWhen men had gathered before the battle started\nthe Israelite\nthey solemnly declared\nat Mizpah\nof us\nNone ever\nwill allow\none of our daughters\nany man from the tribe of Benjamin\nto marry\nBut now went to\nthe Israelites\nBethel\nall day\nuntil\nthe sun went down\nto\nYahweh\nloudly\nand cried\nThey kept saying\nWhy\nYahweh\nGod of\nus Israelite people\nhas happened\nthis\nto us\ndoes not exist\nanymore\nof us Israelites\nof the tribes\none\nthe next morning\nEarly\nthe people\nbuilt\nan altar\nThen some sacrifices on the altar\nthey completely burned\nand also offered other sacrifices to restore fellowship with God\nThen they asked among themselves\nof the tribes of\nIsrael\nWere there any\nwho\nnot\ndid come to Mizpah\nto meet with us\nin the presence of\nYahweh\nbecause\nthey had solemnly declared\nthat anyone who\nnot\ndid meet with them to help fight the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nat Mizpah\nwould be killed\nfelt sorry\nThe Israelites\nfor\nfrom the tribe of Benjamin\ntheir fellow Israelites\nThey said\nhas been cut off\nToday\nof our Israelite tribes\none\nfrom Israel\nWhat\ncan we do to make certain\nthat the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nwho were not killed\nwill have wives\nus\nheard solemnly declare\nYahweh\nthat we would not\nallow\nany man from the tribe of Benjamin\nany of our daughters\nto marry\nThen one of them asked\nWhich\nof\nthe tribes of\nIsrael\nnot\ndid send any men\nhere to\nMizpah\nThey realized that when were counted\nthe soldiers\nno\nthere was\none\nwho had come from the city of\nJabesh\nGilead\nSo decided to\nall the Israelites\ntwelve\nthousand\nsoldiers\nvery good\nsend\nto kill\nthe people there\nto Jabesh\nGilead\neven the women\nand the children\nThey told this to those men This is\nwhat\nyou must do\nevery\nman in Jabesh Gilead\nalso every\nwoman\nmarried But do not kill the unmarried women\nYou must kill You must kill\nSo those soldiers went and killed all the men married women and the children But they found\nthere\nto Jabesh\nGilead\nfour\nhundred\nyoung women\nvirgin\nSo they brought\nthem\nto\ntheir camp\nat Shiloh\nin\nCanaan across the river from the region of Gilead that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin\nThen sent\nall\nthe Israelites who had gathered\na message\nto\nthe six hundred men\nwho were\nat the rock of\nRimmon\nThey said that they would like\nwith them\nto make peace\nSo came back from the rock of Rimmon\nthe men\nThe Israelites gave\nto them\nthe young women\nfrom\nJabesh\nGilead\nBut there were only four hundred women not\nThere were\nfor those six hundred men\nenough women\nThe Israelites\nstill felt sorry\nfor the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nbecause\nhad set\nYahweh\nagainst them\nthe other tribes\nsaid\nleaders\nThe Israelite\nWhere\ncan we get women\nof the men who are still alive\nto be wives\nWe have killed\nof the tribe of Benjamin\nall the married women\nThese men must have wives to give birth to children in order that will continue\ntheir families\nof Benjamin\nIf that does not happen\nwill all die out and will be destroyed\nall the people of one of the tribes the tribe\nof Israel\nBut we\ncannot\nallow\nthese men\nto marry\nour daughters\nbecause\nsolemnly declared\nwe\nthat\nYahweh will curse\nanyone who gives\none of his daughters to become a wife\nof any man of the tribe of Benjamin\nThen they had an idea They said\nthere is a festival\nto honor Yahweh\nat Shiloh\nEvery year\nwhich is\nnorth\nof Bethel\nand east\nof the road\nthat extends\nfrom Bethel\nto Shechem\nand it is south\nof the city of Lebonah\nSo the Israelite leaders told\nthe men of\nthe tribe of Benjamin\nWhen it is the time for that festival go to Shiloh\nand hide\nin the vineyards\nKeep watching\nfor\nto come out\nthe young women\nof the city\nto dance\nWhen they come out run\nout of\nthe vineyards\ncan seize\none of\nEach of you\nthe young women of\nShiloh\nThen you can all return to\nyour homes with those women\nIf\ncome\ntheir fathers\nor\nbrothers\nto us\nwe will say\nto them\nAct kindly\ntoward the men of the tribe of Benjamin\nnot\nwe did leave\nany women alive to become their wives\nWhen we fought them\nand\nnot\nyou\ndid give those young women\nto the men from the tribe of Benjamin\nThey stole them So you will not be guilty even though you said that you would not give any of your daughters to marry one of them\nSo did\nwhat They went to Shiloh at the time of the festival\nthe men of\nthe tribe of Benjamin\nAnd caught\nthe young women\neach man\none of them\nwhen were dancing\nand took her away\nand married her\nThen they took their wives back\nto\nthe land that God had given to them\nThey rebuilt\ntheir cities that had been burned down\nand they lived\nthere\nThe other Israelites\nto their home in the areas where their tribes\nand clans lived\nwent\nthe areas that God had allotted to them\nAt that time\ndid not have\na king\nthe Israelite people\nEveryone\nwhat was right\naccording to his own opinion\ndid";
